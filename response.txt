"America" can refer to several things, so it depends on the context:

**1. The United States of America:**  This is the most common meaning. It's a country located in North America, officially formed in 1776. 

**2. The continent of North America:**  Sometimes people use "America" to refer to the entire continent, including Canada, Mexico, and other countries. This usage is less common but still occurs.

**3. The Western Hemisphere:** Some people even use "America" to refer to the whole Western Hemisphere, including South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. This is the least common usage.

**4. A cultural identity:**  "America" can also represent a shared cultural identity, with values like freedom, democracy, and individualism. This meaning is often connected to the United States, but it can also encompass other parts of the Americas.

**To understand what "America" means in a specific situation, consider the context.** If someone says "I'm going to America," they likely mean the United States. If someone talks about "American culture," they might be referring to the cultural identity associated with the whole Western Hemisphere or just the United States.
